👋🏽 Hi! I'm a current college student studying Computing, with a growing passion for data analytics, consulting, and tech.

I'm currently learning tools like Excel, SQL, Power BI, and have explored Python (pandas, numpy) for analyzing real-world datasets from platforms like Kaggle.

I recently attended the Leeds Digital Ball, where I had the chance to network with professionals in the tech industry, a highlight that pushed me even more toward a career in analytics or consulting.

I'm curious, quick to learn, and excited about opportunities to apply what I’m learning in real projects. Open to internships, mentorships, or simply connecting with people in the field.
